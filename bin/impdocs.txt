Finally, i solved the problem. I placed the `nitm.sql` file in `bin` file of 
the `mysql` folder and used the following syntax.

G:\>C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql -u root

C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.0.51b\bin>mysql -u root nitm < nitm.sql

No, you should run mysql -u root -p in bash, not at the MySQL command-line. 
If you are in mysql, you can exit by typing exit.

First, Identify the user you are logged in as:

 select user();
 select current_user();
The result for the first command is what you attempted to login as, 
the second is what you actually connected as. Confirm that you are 
logged in as root@localhost in mysql.

Grant_priv to root@localhost. Here is how you can check.


You can see that the Grant_priv is set to N for root@localhost. This needs to be Y. Below is how to fixed this:

UPDATE mysql.user SET Grant_priv='Y', Super_priv='Y' WHERE User='root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost';
